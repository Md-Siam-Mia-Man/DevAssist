## 🤔 Why Does DevAssist Exist?

Ever found yourself in a loop of...

- 😭 Trying to paste your entire project into a chat window, only to hit the context limit?
- 😵‍💫 Manually copying and pasting a dozen files, losing all sense of the project's structure?
- 🧩 Pasting just an error message, knowing the AI needs more context but not wanting to find and copy it all?
- 🥱 Writing boring commit messages when an AI could do it better with the right `git diff`?

**DevAssist is here to fix that!** It's a simple, powerful toolkit designed to eliminate the friction between your local development workflow and Large Language Models (LLMs). It programmatically packages your code, diffs, and errors into perfect, context-rich prompts, so you can spend less time copy-pasting and more time building.

## ✨ Features

- **📦 `export`**: Bundle your entire project structure and code into a single, clean text file.
- **🧠 `Intelligent Framework Detection`**: Automatically detects your project's framework (React, Vue, Django, etc.) to give your AI better high-level context.
- **🔪 `chunk`**: Slice large files into AI-friendly, digestible chunks with a handy table of contents.
- **🎭 `diff`**: Show a Git-style diff to your AI, providing crucial "before and after" context.
- **🚑 `error`**: Instantly package an error log with the relevant code snippet that caused it.
- **✍️ `commit`**: Generate a context-aware `git diff` to have an AI write your commit messages for you.

## 📦 Installation

Install it globally using npm to get access to the `devassist` command from anywhere on your system!

```bash
npm install -g @devassist-for-ai/devassist
```

_**Note:** Even though the package name is scoped, the command you'll run is still the simple and convenient `devassist`!_

## 🛠️ Usage Guide

### `devassist export`

Exports your project code and structure into a single file. It intelligently detects your framework to give your AI the best possible context.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Export the whole project (with automatic framework detection)
devassist export

# Export only specific folders/files to a custom output file
devassist export --only src,package.json --output context.md

# Exclude specific folders
devassist export --exclude tests,dist

# Manually specify the framework to override detection
devassist export --framework "Next.js"
```

### `devassist chunk <file>`

Splits a large file into smaller parts, perfect for staying within an AI's context limit.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Chunk a file into default 150-line parts and print to console
devassist chunk src/utils/file-handler.js

# Chunk into 50-line parts and save to a file
devassist chunk src/very-big-file.js --max-lines 50 --output chunks.txt
```

### `devassist diff <file> [commit]`

Generates a diff of a file against the last commit (`HEAD`) or a specific commit hash.

**Usage:**

```bash
# See changes in a file compared to the last commit
devassist diff src/commands/export.js

# Compare against a specific commit
devassist diff src/commands/export.js a1b2c3d
```

### `devassist error <logfile>`

Grabs an error from a log file and bundles it with the surrounding code for easy debugging with an AI.

**Usage:**

```bash
# (First, you need a log file with an error in it!)
# Then run:
devassist error logs/app-error.log
```

_This will output a perfectly formatted block to copy to your AI._

### `devassist commit`

Generates a context bundle from your staged Git changes, ready for an AI to write a commit message.

**Usage:**

```bash
# 1. Stage your changes
git add .

# 2. Generate the context (just the diff)
devassist commit

# 3. Or generate a more detailed context (full file contents)
devassist commit --full
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

For project-specific rules, create a `.aiconfig.json` file in your project's root. The default configuration already supports a wide variety of languages and ignores common directories like `node_modules`.

**Example `.aiconfig.json`:**

```json
{
  "ignoreDirs": ["node_modules", ".git", "dist", "coverage", ".next"],
  "ignoreFiles": [".env.local"],
  "includeExt": [".js", ".ts", ".tsx", ".json", ".md"]
}
```

## 💬 A Word From The Creators

This is a fun hobby project built to solve a problem we face every day. It's a collaboration between a human developer (**Md Siam Mia**) and the very AI systems it's designed to help.

We believe this human-AI partnership is the future of software development, and tools like DevAssist are a small step toward making that future more efficient and enjoyable for everyone.
